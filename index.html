            <p>Very unique and for a subtitled movie is a very easy follow. Great plot twists as well. I only wish it had been longer to be honest. It's always refreshing to break away from the generic plots of American movies now days that are created solely for maximum global profits and are translatable. This is a foreign gem that is very well made with great acting and story lines. Kudos to the makeup artists, actors, and director for this lovely piece. Keep up the good work HULU for adding foreign films to the mix.</p>
